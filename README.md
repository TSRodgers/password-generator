## password-generator

# This password generator is a browser based javascript program that works off of window prompts and window confirms. Upon clicking the generate button the user will be prompted to decide how long they would like their password to be from 8 to 128. If a value that isnt a number or is less than 8 or greater than 128 is entered, the user will be thrown an error and prompted to try again. Upon succesful completion the user will then go through a series of confirm windows to decide on what character types that will be used in their password. If no character sets are chosen the user is thrown an error and told that they need to choose at least one set and to try again. Upon succesful completion, a password will be generated using a random string of the character types they selected and how long they chose it to be.

#This program has not been fully bug tested and is likely to have some bugs still yet to be found.
